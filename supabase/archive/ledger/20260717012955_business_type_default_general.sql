-- ARCHIVED MIGRATION — HISTORY ONLY. DO NOT RE-RUN.
--
--   version : 20260717012955
--   name    : business_type_default_general
--
-- Recovered on 2026-08-13 from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations — the SQL
-- production actually executed, not a repo file that was believed to match it.
-- Several of these migrations never had a repo file at all.
--
-- Its effects are already folded into supabase/migrations/*_baseline.sql. This
-- copy exists so the reason a column looks the way it does is answerable, and for
-- no other purpose. Re-running one replaces a live object with an older body —
-- silently, with no error. That has already broken the customer portal twice.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

-- Default served the 2026-07-15 backfill (rows keep stored values); ongoing
-- default must be the neutral fail-safe so an accidental row creation is never
-- lawn-branded. Non-destructive: DEFAULT only, no row touched.
