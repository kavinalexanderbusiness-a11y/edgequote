-- ARCHIVED MIGRATION — HISTORY ONLY. DO NOT RE-RUN.
--
--   version : 20260716060320
--   name    : scheduled_messages_claimed_at
--
-- Recovered on 2026-08-13 from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations — the SQL
-- production actually executed, not a repo file that was believed to match it.
-- Several of these migrations never had a repo file at all.
--
-- Its effects are already folded into supabase/migrations/*_baseline.sql. This
-- copy exists so the reason a column looks the way it does is answerable, and for
-- no other purpose. Re-running one replaces a live object with an older body —
-- silently, with no error. That has already broken the customer portal twice.
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

-- Stale-claim detection must key on WHEN the claim was taken, not send_at — a
-- backlogged row (due long ago, claimed seconds ago) is not stale.
